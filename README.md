## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css .cards {
  overflow: hidden;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```


### Continued development

I'll focus on using flexbox it help me making layout easilly and helping me in responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox items. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
